## üîß Technical Details

- Uses Clerk's `useOAuth` hook with `oauth_google` strategy
- Implements `expo-web-browser` for OAuth flow
- Handles OAuth callback with `WebBrowser.maybeCompleteAuthSession()`
- Creates session and redirects to home on success

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Development**: OAuth works best on real devices or emulators with Google Play Services
2. **URLs**: Make sure your redirect URIs match exactly (trailing slashes matter!)
3. **Testing**: Test on both iOS and Android as behavior can differ
4. **Production**: Update your OAuth settings when you deploy to production

## üé® UI Design

The Google button features:

- Google search emoji (üîç) for branding
- Border style for secondary action
- Disabled state when loading
- Matches the app's design system

## Next Steps

Once you've enabled Google OAuth in Clerk, users can:

- Sign up with Google (creates new account)
- Sign in with Google (if account exists)
- Link Google to existing email/password account (future feature)
